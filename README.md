The project in which I participated in IAYC 2018 aimed to predict the orbit of a star, given its mass and the orbits of its planets.

In the file "1-Orbit.py", you can find the python script which draws the whole orbit of the star with only one planet, and the whole orbit of the planet.

In the file "2-Orbit_angle.py" you can find the python script which draws the orbits of the star and the planet in different moments, given a certain angle.

In the file "3-Orbit_time.py" you can find the python script which draws the orbit of the star and the planet in different moments, given a certain time.

In the file "4-Orbit_pluto" you can find an approximation of Pluto and its satellites' orbits.
